// channel-reminder.ts — UserPromptSubmit hook that re-injects the Telegram
// bridge invariant on EVERY warchief turn.
//
// Why this exists (2026-06-12): agents run as long-lived `claude … server:
// dashi-channel` sessions. The dashi-channel MCP server states the reply
// discipline once at session start ("the sender reads Telegram, not this
// terminal"), and plugin/CLAUDE.md repeats it as a durable invariant — but
// over a long session both fade, and agents end turns with terminal-only
// text the warchief never sees. A UserPromptSubmit hook fires on every
// inbound prompt, so emitting the reminder here re-grounds the model each
// turn instead of relying on start-of-session context alone.
//
// Output contract: a single JSON object on stdout carrying
// `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` — Claude Code prepends that string
// to the turn as context. It is NEVER sent to Telegram; the only way it
// reaches the chat is if the model parrots it, so the text stays terse.
//
// Hard invariants (shared with the other dashi hooks):
//   * Exit code 0 in EVERY path — a non-zero hook blocks the model; a
//     missing reminder must never gate the turn.
//   * stdout carries ONLY the JSON envelope (no logs, no secrets) — anything
//     else on stdout becomes additional model context.
//   * No file reads/writes; configuration is env-only.
//
// Env:
//   CHAT_ID   the Telegram chat id this session serves. Negative ids are
//             groups/supergroups (multichat); anything else is treated as a
//             direct chat with the warchief. Absent → DM-safe generic.
